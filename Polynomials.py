UNIT 3: Functions and APIs: Polynomials

A polynomial is a mathematical formula like:

    30 * x**2 + 20 * x + 10

More formally, it involves a single variable (here 'x'), and the sum of one
or more terms, where each term is a real number multiplied by the variable
raised to a non-negative integer power. (Remember that x**0 is 1 and x**1 is x,
so 'x' is short for '1 * x**1' and '10' is short for '10 * x**0'.)

We will represent a polynomial as a Python function which computes the formula
when applied to a numeric value x.  The function will be created with the call:

    p1 = poly((10, 20, 30))

where the nth element of the input tuple is the coefficient of the nth power of x.
(Note the order of coefficients has the x**n coefficient neatly in position n of 
the list, but this is the reversed order from how we usually write polynomials.)
poly returns a function, so we can now apply p1 to some value of x:

    p1(0) == 10

Our representation of a polynomial is as a callable function, but in addition,
we will store the coefficients in the .coefs attribute of the function, so we have:

    p1.coefs == (10, 20, 30)

And finally, the name of the function will be the formula given above, so you should
have something like this:

    >>> p1
    <function 30 * x**2 + 20 * x + 10 at 0x100d71c08>

    >>> p1.__name__
    '30 * x**2 + 20 * x + 10'

Make sure the formula used for function names is simplified properly.
No '0 * x**n' terms; just drop these. Simplify '1 * x**n' to 'x**n'.
Simplify '5 * x**0' to '5'.  Similarly, simplify 'x**1' to 'x'.
For negative coefficients, like -5, you can use '... + -5 * ...' or
'... - 5 * ...'; your choice. I'd recommend no spaces around '**' 
and spaces around '+' and '*', but you are free to use your preferences.

Your task is to write the function poly and the following additional functions:

    is_poly, add, sub, mul, power, deriv, integral

They are described below; see the test_poly function for examples.

If your calculus is rusty (or non-existant), here is a refresher:
The deriviative of a polynomial term (c * x**n) is (c*n * x**(n-1)).
The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.
So the derivative of (30 * x**2 + 20 * x + 10) is (60 * x + 20).

The integral is the anti-derivative:
The integral of 60 * x + 20 is  30 * x**2 + 20 * x + C, for any constant C.
Any value of C is an equally good anti-derivative.  We allow C as an argument
to the function integral (withh default C=0).

Now for an extra credit challenge: arrange to describe polynomials with an
expression like '3 * x**2 + 5 * x + 9' rather than (9, 5, 3).  You can do this
in one (or both) of two ways:

(1) By defining poly as a class rather than a function, and overloading the 
__add__, __sub__, __mul__, and __pow__ operators, etc.  If you choose this,
call the function test_poly1().  Make sure that poly objects can still be called.

(2) Using the grammar parsing techniques we learned in Unit 5. For this
approach, define a new function, Poly, which takes one argument, a string,
as in Poly('30 * x**2 + 20 * x + 10').  Call test_poly2().
